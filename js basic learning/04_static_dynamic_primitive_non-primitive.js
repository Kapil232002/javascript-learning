                    //   +++++++++++++primitive datatype+++++++++

//7 types of primitive datatypes:-

//string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, number, bigint

                        // +++++++Non-primitive(reference type) datatype+++++++++
            
// Array, Objects, Funcions


        //   +++++++++++Static programming++++++++++++

/*Before execution, we declare the datatype of the variable and we cant change that later
before execution, it just check the datatype and need to declare it

like:-
int x =4;  //correct
x = "hello" //incorrect

Example: -
c++, java, go, rust
*/


        //   +++++++++++Dynamic programming++++++++++++

/*It depends on runtime, during runtime it will check the variable datatype and no need
to declare the datatype , it will automatically get the datatype.

like:-
x =4;  //correct and it will auto consider the datatype as int and also can be change further
x = "hello" // correct too and changed , it will nor depend the upper one as int.

Example: -
Javascript, python , ruby,  php
